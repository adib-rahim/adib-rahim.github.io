        <h1>Iceland</h1>

  <p><b><i>Iceland</i></b> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset
  by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

<li>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name
for the north wind,Boreas. From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.</li>
<li>The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon
created when particle emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases
energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.</li>

<p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's
namesake—namely, its 4,500
square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly
on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered
from Reykjavík (and Skaftafell).</p>
