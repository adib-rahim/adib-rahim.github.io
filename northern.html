                <i>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis,</i> or northern lights, begin high in the Earth’s atmosphere—at
                altitudesfrom 60 to more than 250 miles—when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the
                Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.

        <p>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more
            accessible places if you’d like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial
            scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light pollution. Find your magnetic
            latitude on NOAA and here.</p>
        <p>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily
            the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth’s magnetic field lets more solar particles
            interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there
            are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location</p>
